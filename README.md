Develop a tool aimed at aiding businesses in selecting applicants for funding who have the highest likelihood of success in their ventures. Leveraging machine learning and neural networks, we constructed a binary classifier capable of predicting the success of applicants once funded. Our model is trained on a dataset comprising 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding. This dataset serves as the foundation for our predictive model.
